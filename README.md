# SPHERExLabTools

SPHERExLabTools (SLT) provides a general purpose laboratory data acquisition and instrument control system with driver level 
software for control of testbed instrumentation, graphical interfaces, real-time data visualization, processing, data archival tools 
for a variety of output file formats, and mechanisms to run manual and automated measurements. Each component is highly configurable with 
minimal manual coding required by a user.

SLT draws inspiration from the existing PyMeasure and PyHk projects. Many low-level architecture details are drawn directly from PyMeasure 
and the configuration file based interface was inspired by PyHk.
